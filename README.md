Gesture driven Pacman-like game, mainly testing a concept created in response to a StackOverflow question, there isn't any collision detection, path finding or indeed even paths. It is merely an example of how to make 'Pac-Man' change direction when a swipe occurs. The chomping needed to happen in all directions.
